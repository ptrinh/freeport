# Freeport — Roadmap / Deferred work

Items intentionally postponed, with enough context to pick them up later.

## Lock-screen live progress (Live Activity) — deferred until native build

**Goal:** show deal/trip progress on the phone lock screen + Dynamic Island
(like Grab/Be/Xanh SM), driven by the existing fulfillment stages
(Confirmed → Picked up → Completed).

**Why deferred:** not possible in the current targets.
- Web (Cloudflare Pages PWA): browsers have no API to draw on the lock screen — never possible. Only ordinary web push.
- Expo Go: sandbox, can't run custom native modules.

**How to do it when ready (no webview wrap — build native from this same RN codebase):**
1. Leave Expo Go → set up **EAS Build** (dev + production), or eject to bare workflow.
2. **iOS:** ActivityKit Live Activity = a small Swift widget extension. Use a
   community lib (`expo-live-activity` / `react-native-live-activity`) to
   start/update from JS. Requires iOS 16.1+ and an **Apple Developer account ($99/yr)**.
3. **Android (cheaper/faster, do first to prove the concept):** foreground
   service + ongoing notification with a progress bar, via Notifee or
   expo-notifications.
4. Wire the fulfillment stage transitions (DealsTab `setStageFor`) to
   start/update/end the activity.

**Key constraint — no backend:** Freeport is pure P2P/Nostr with no server.
Remote Live Activity updates need APNs/a push server. Without one, updates are
**local only** (while the app is running/backgrounded — e.g. the driver taps
"Picked up" → widget updates). To update after the app is fully closed, we'd
need a small push relay. Acceptable v1: local updates only.

**Consequence:** the app would split into two targets sharing one codebase —
**web** (no lock-screen) and a **native EAS build** (has it).

Decision (2026-06): keep web + Expo Go for now; revisit when we commit to a
native build.

Update (2026-07): native EAS builds now exist (App Store + Play). The remaining
work is just the widget extension + stage wiring above; local-only updates
still apply (no push server).

## Grab-parity features (multi-stop, delivery batching, ride pooling)

No central dispatcher in Freeport, so each of these is re-expressed as
peer-side logic + small protocol conventions — matching quality scales with
local intent liquidity, not with an optimizer. Recommended order:

### 1. Multi-stop rides — small
- Add an ordered `stops` array to the intent template alongside `from`/`to`
  (older clients ignore it and still see the primary pair — backward compatible).
- Price negotiation unchanged. UI: stop list editor in the post form, stops
  rendered on the deal card / route link.

### 2. Delivery intents + driver-side batching — medium
- **Scope**: peer courier marketplace ("ship hộ / mua hộ" — pickup at X,
  drop at Y, what item, who fronts the goods payment), NOT integrated food
  ordering. Menus/restaurant POS/payments need a central operator — non-goal.
- New intent kind/template for deliveries (size/weight class, declared value,
  who-pays-goods flag).
- **Batching is client-side only**: a driver holds N independent deals. The
  driver agent scans open delivery intents, scores route compatibility against
  the currently-committed corridor (geohash prefixes + existing haversine
  helpers), auto-counters compatible ones. No protocol change — deals stay 1:1.

### 3. Ride pooling (shared car) — hard, needs liquidity first
- Rider opts in with a `shareable` flag (accepts co-riders for a lower price).
- Driver-side matching: driver with confirmed deal A sees compatible intent B
  (route overlap + time window) → counters B at share pricing. Deals remain
  pairwise; the driver simply holds two.
- Hard parts are UX/incentives, not protocol: route-detour consent, fair split,
  cancellation of one leg, and enough same-area intents for matches to exist.
  Revisit once real usage clusters somewhere.
